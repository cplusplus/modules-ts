TODO:
header import preprocessor effects
preamble identification

module partition import and export: do we need 'export import :partition' to match 'export module foo:partition', or just infer it?

WORDING QUESTIONS:
do we need ASG etc? can we simplify it?
do we need modules-as-entities?

TO DISCUSS WITH EWG:
namespace export rules
ADL and path of instantiation
#export
public import or restricted import
