  point of declaration (6.3.2) onwards;
   and for each \grammarterm{using-directive}

\begin{std.txt}
  \resetalinea[1]
  \alinea
  For each argument type \tcode{T} in the function call, there is a
  set of zero or more \term{associated namespaces} (10.3) and a set of
  zero or more \term{associated \removed{classes} \added{entities}}
  \added{(other than namespaces)} to be considered.  The sets of
  namespaces and \removed{classes} \added{entities} are determined
  entirely by the types of the function arguments (and the namespace
  of any template template argument).  Typedef names and
  \grammarterm{using-declaration}{s} used to specify the types do not
  contribute to this set.  The sets of namespaces
  and \removed{classes} \added{entities} are determined in the
  following way:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item[---] If \tcode{T} is a fundamental type, its associated sets
  of namespaces and \removed{classes} \added{entities} are both empty.

  \item[---] If \tcode{T} is a class type (including unions), its
  associated \removed{classes} \added{entities} are the class itself;
  the class of which it is a member, if any; and its direct and
  indirect base classes.  Its associated namespaces are the innermost
  enclosing namespaces of its associated \removed{classes} \added{entities}.
  Furthermore, if \tcode{T} is a class template specialization, its
  associated namespaces and \removed{classes} \added{entities} also
  include: the namespace and \removed{classes} \added{entities}
  associated with the types of the template arguments provided for
  template type parameters (excluding template template arguments);
  \added{the templates used as template template arguments;} the
  namespaces of which any template template arguments are members;
  and the classes of which any member template used as template
  template arguments are members. \enternote Non-type template
  arguments do not contribute to the set of associated namespaces. \exitnote

  \item[---] If \tcode{T} is an enumeration type, its associated
  namespace is the innermost enclosing namespace of its
  declaration\added{, and its associated entities are \tcode{T}, and,
  if}\removed{. If} it is a class member, \removed{its associated
  class is} the member's class\removed{; else it has no associated class}.

  \item[---] If \tcode{T} is a pointer to \tcode{U} or an array
  of \tcode{U}, its associated namespaces
  and \removed{classes} \added{entities} are those associated
  with \tcode{U}. 

  \item[---] If \tcode{T} is a function type, its associated
  namespaces and \removed{classes} \added{entities} are those
  associated with the function parameter types and those associated
  with the return type.

  \item[---] If \tcode{T} is a pointer to a data member of
  class \tcode{X}, its associated namespaces
  and \removed{classes} \added{entities} are those associated with the
  member type together with those associated with \tcode{X}.
  \end{itemize}

  If an associated namespace is an inline namespace (10.3.1), its
  enclosing namespace is also included in the set.  If an associated
  namespace directly contains inline namespaces, those inline
  namespaces are also included in the set.  In addition, if the
  argument is the name or address of a set of overloaded functions
  and/or function templates, its
  associated \removed{classes} \added{entities} and namespaces are the
  union of those associated with each of the members of the set, i.e.,
  the \removed{classes} \added{entities} and namespaces associated
  with its parameter types and return type.  Additionally, if the
  aforementioned set of overloaded functions is named with
  a \grammarterm{template-id}, its
  associated \removed{classes} \added{entities} and namespaces also
  include those of its type \grammarterm{template-argument}{s} and its
  template \grammarterm{template-argument}{s}.

  function templates declared in \removed{associated}
