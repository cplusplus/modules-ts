\textbf{\Huge
Merging Modules}
\end{center}

This document presents the changes to be applied to the Modules TS in order
to merge the features of the Atom proposal, as directed by Evolution at the
Jacksonville 2018 committee meeting.

A note aboute stylistic conventions: as this document describes a ``diff of
a diff,'' the usual convention of using text style for \added{added} and
\removed{removed} text does not work well. In its place, we use block-style
diffs showing the text of the Modules TS before and after this document is
applied:

\begin{before}
Here is some text from the \Cpp standard
\added{with some additions from the Modules TS}.
\end{before}

\begin{after}
Here is some text from the \Cpp standard
\added{with some additions from the Modules TS}
\added{and some more from the Atom proposal}.
\end{after}

Unchanged text from the Modules TS is retained in this document so that a
complete picture of the ``after'' wording may be obtained by simply ignoring
the ``before'' regions.
