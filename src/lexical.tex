    \enternote
    Previously translated translation units and instantiation units can be 
    preserved individually or in libraries. The separate translation units of 
    a program communicate (\ref{basic.link}) by (for example) calls to functions whose 
    identifiers have external \added{or module} linkage, manipulation of objects whose 
    identifiers have external \added{or module} linkage, or manipulation of data files. 
    Translation units can be separately translated and then later linked to produce 
    an executable program (\ref{basic.link}).

    White-space characters separating tokens are no longer significant. 
    Each preprocessing token is converted into a token (5.6). 
    The resulting tokens are syntactically and semantically analyzed and 
    translated as a translation unit.

    The process of analyzing and translating the tokens may occasionally 
    result in one token being replaced by a sequence of other tokens (17.2).

    The result of processing a translation unit from phases 1 through 7
    is a directed graph called the \term{abstract semantics graph} of
    the translation unit:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Each vertex, called a \term{declset}, is
            a citation (\ref{dcl.module.import}), or a collection of 
            non-local declarations and redeclarations (Clause \ref{dcl.dcl})
            declaring the same entity or other non-local declarations
            of the same name that do not declare an entity.
        \item A directed edge $(D_1, D_2)$ exists in the graph if and only if the 
        declarations contained in $D_2$ declare an entity mentioned 
        in a declaration contained in $D_1$.
    \end{itemize}
    The \term{abstract semantics graph of a module} is
    \begin{before}\color{addclr}
    the subgraph of
    the abstract semantics graph of its module interface unit generated
    by the declsets the declarations of which are
    in the purview of that module interface unit.

    The abstract semantics graphs of modules,
    as appropriately restricted (\ref{dcl.module.reach}), are used in

    (\ref{dcl.module.import}) and module implementation units.
