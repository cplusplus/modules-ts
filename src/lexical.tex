    \enternote
    Previously translated translation units and instantiation units can be 
    preserved individually or in libraries. The separate translation units of 
    a program communicate (\ref{basic.link}) by (for example) calls to functions whose 
    identifiers have external \added{or module} linkage, manipulation of objects whose 
    identifiers have external \added{or module} linkage, or manipulation of data files. 
    Translation units can be separately translated and then later linked to produce 
    an executable program (\ref{basic.link}).

    White-space characters separating tokens are no longer significant.

    The result of processing a translation unit from phases 1 through 7
    is a directed graph called the \term{abstract semantics graph} of
    the translation unit:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Each vertex, called a \term{declset}, is
            a citation (\ref{dcl.module.import}), or a collection of 
            non-local declarations and redeclarations (Clause \ref{dcl.dcl})
            declaring the same entity or other non-local declarations
            of the same name that do not declare an entity.
        \item A directed edge $(D_1, D_2)$ exists in the graph if and only if the 
        declarations contained in $D_2$ declare an entity mentioned 
        in a declaration contained in $D_1$.
    \end{itemize}
    The \term{abstract semantics graph of a module} is
    \begin{before}\color{addclr}
    the subgraph of
    the abstract semantics graph of its module interface unit generated
    by the declsets the declarations of which are

    The abstract semantics graphs of modules,
